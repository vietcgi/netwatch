# Security Guide for Netwatch

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive security guidelines for developers, maintainers, and users of the Netwatch network monitoring tool.

## Security Architecture

### Memory Safety
- **Rust Ownership System**: Prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free, and data races
- **No Unsafe Code**: The codebase avoids `unsafe` blocks entirely
- **Panic Safety**: Critical system operations wrapped in panic protection (`src/safe_system.rs`)

### Privilege Model
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Runs with minimal required permissions
- **No Root Required**: Basic functionality works without elevated privileges
- **Read-Only Operations**: Only reads network interface statistics, never modifies system state

### Network Security
- **Local Access Only**: Does not send data over the network
- **Interface Validation**: Validates network interface names before access
- **No Network Transmission**: All monitoring is local-only

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Security
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs and system data
2. **Error Handling**: Use structured error types (`src/error.rs`)
3. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never embed credentials or sensitive data
4. **Dependency Security**: Regular auditing with `cargo audit` and `cargo deny`

### Testing Security
1. **Unit Tests**: Cover security-critical functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test privilege boundaries
3. **Fuzz Testing**: Use `cargo fuzz` for input validation
4. **Static Analysis**: Run `cargo clippy` with security lints

### Development Workflow
1. **Code Review**: All changes require security review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular security updates
3. **SBOM Generation**: Maintain software bill of materials
4. **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning

## Security Configuration

### Runtime Security
```bash
# Run with minimal privileges
netwatch --devices eth0

# Use configuration file for settings
echo 'devices = "eth0"' > ~/.netwatch

# Enable logging for audit trails
netwatch --log-file /var/log/netwatch.log
```

### System Hardening
1. **File Permissions**: Ensure config files are not world-readable
2. **Log Security**: Protect log files from unauthorized access
3. **Process Isolation**: Run in isolated environments when possible

## Vulnerability Response

### Reporting Security Issues
- **Email**: security@netwatch.project (if available)
- **GitHub**: Use private security advisories
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours

### Security Updates
1. **Critical**: Immediate patch release
2. **High**: Within 1 week
3. **Medium**: Next minor release
4. **Low**: Next major release

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Daily security audits via GitHub Actions
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- SBOM generation and validation

### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly security assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Code review for security implications

## Security Tools Integration

### Required Tools
```bash
# Install security scanning tools
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo install cargo-deny
cargo install cargo-cyclonedx
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

### CI/CD Security
- Automated security scanning on all PRs
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- License compliance verification
- SBOM generation and archival

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling
1. **Detection**: Automated scanning and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Response**: Patch development and coordinated disclosure
4. **Recovery**: Deployment and verification
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and documentation

### Communication Plan
- **Internal**: Development team notification
- **External**: User notification via security advisories
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Responsible vulnerability disclosure

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management approach
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Secure coding practices
- **CIS Controls**: Implementation of security controls

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR**: Data protection (network statistics are not personal data)
- **SOX**: Audit trail capabilities for enterprise users
- **HIPAA**: Secure monitoring for healthcare environments

## Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) for vulnerabilities
- Security scan coverage percentage
- Dependency freshness metrics
- Incident response time

### Reporting
- Monthly security dashboard
- Quarterly vulnerability reports
- Annual security posture assessment

## Emergency Contacts

### Security Team
- **Lead**: [Security Lead Contact]
- **Backup**: [Backup Contact]
- **External**: [Security Consultant]

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Developer** → **Maintainer** → **Security Lead**
2. **Critical Issues**: Direct to Security Lead
3. **External Reports**: Security Lead + Legal
